# Janus product and current context

## Research-task workspace

The current implementation follows [demo.md](../demo.md): task-owned budgets, paid-source reuse, checkpointed worker handoff and independent owner recovery. `/dashboard/agents` creates/configures workers and `/dashboard/runs` executes and monitors parallel research; `/dashboard/credentials` retains encrypted provider-key storage. User-key provider brokerage is connected to the separate research runtime; live provider calls remain unverified. The paid checkpoint runner is not yet wired into browser research steps. Arkiv v2 profile publication/query now feeds operator-triggered checkpoint replacement with owner policy and signed readiness. Local fixture-directory handoff and a live independent query pass; funded testnet publication, remote worker transport and combined live evidence remain pending. See [ARKIV.md](ARKIV.md). Read-only Hedera checks remain available. See [WORKBENCH.md](WORKBENCH.md) and [DASHBOARD_RUNTIME.md](DASHBOARD_RUNTIME.md).

Local container orchestration is available through root Docker Compose: persistent local EVM, automatic token/treasury/task bootstrap, task-aware merchant and frontend. See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md). This changes no live-network or sponsor verification claim and does not connect the illustrative dashboard to local treasury state.

Janus is the current project name. RelayBudget is the original research/prototype name retained in source provenance and historical evidence.

## Product

Money belongs to a task; workers have temporary spending authority. A replacement worker must resume with the correct available budget, reuse paid results and leave pending obligations intact. Example: a 100-unit task with 20 spent and 10 reserved has 70 available. Epoch increments fence old workers from new commitments. Owner recovery must remain possible without the application backend.

## Implemented and verified

- Solidity Phase 0: bounded payment and owner recovery.
- Solidity Phase 1: isolated task caps, reservations, single settlement, expiry/retry attempts, worker epochs, cancellation, release to reserve and owner withdrawal.
- Restricted Hedera Phase-0 merchant/facilitator and offline settlement checks.
- Next.js frontend with Privy identity plumbing and illustrative accounting dashboard.
- Repository orchestration uses independent frontend/backend/contracts lockfiles, Node.js 22, a combined `check` command and CI. Root contains no application dependencies. Local test reports are isolated from committed historical evidence.
- Fresh consistency-phase verification on 6 November 2026, Node.js 22.23.4: `npm run check` passed repository checks, frontend lint/types, both contract compilers, 9 Phase-0 and 9 Phase-1 scenarios, 8 settlement checks plus 4 merchant HTTP scenarios, 5 authentication scenarios, and the production build. Production HTTP smoke checks passed `/`, `/login`, `/dashboard` (200) and unauthenticated `/api/session` (401). No live transactions were submitted. Saved proof JSON is not a substitute for rerunning checks.

Historical Hedera evidence is not a fresh chain verification. No live funds were moved during restructuring.

## Important boundaries

The dashboard uses the local treasury and merchant in Compose and supports validated Hedera testnet reads in standalone mode. Phase-0 payment authorization is 32 bytes; Phase-1 requires 96 bytes encoding task ID, operation ID and uint64 attempt. Durable merchant results and task-aware SDK have local and bounded Hedera testnet proof. Checkpointed handoff runs in the dashboard with independently interruptible worker processes. Independent browser recovery passes local Chromium wallet acceptance; manual extension-wallet/live recovery remains unverified. An independently usable Node.js recovery client now exists and is verified locally against deployment identity and current contract state. No audit, production readiness, transaction anonymity or validated demand is claimed.

Available, reserved, spent, released-to-reserve and withdrawn are distinct quantities. Cancellation does not refund settled purchases or invalidate existing reservations. Unknown payment outcomes require reconciliation before retrying.

Repository phase names describe implementation slices: Phase 1 is the multi-task financial core. In the original dossier, that work maps largely to Phase 2. The independent reference model and bounded differential traces are implemented. Full dossier contract-spec acceptance and production worker orchestration remain incomplete; no dossier phase should be declared complete solely from the folder name.

## Paid merchant phase completed locally

Task-aware SDK, pinned treasury adapter, merchant-signed quotes, current-worker/owner request authentication, fsynced operation/result storage and HTTP retrieval are implemented. Local EVM/HTTP regressions verify a paid-response failure, restart, replacement result access, no duplicate debit, missing-result owner decision and an independent task purchase. This is a custom signed HTTP reference adapter, not a general x402 interoperability certification or a fresh live Hedera proof. See `PAID_WORKFLOW.md` for durability assumptions and limits. Checkpointed workflow execution is the next phase.

## Dependency maintenance

The 6 November 2026 frontend production dependency audit reported 28 advisories (17 high, 11 moderate), largely in the existing Privy/wallet integration tree. The suggested Privy replacement is a breaking version change/downgrade, so it was not applied automatically as part of repository cleanup. Passing local checks does not clear these advisories. Review supported Privy/wallet versions, transitive updates and authentication regressions as a dedicated dependency migration before a production release.

## Treasury integration readiness

Hedera testnet is the selected single settlement network. Shared network configuration, versioned ABI/hash, canonical string-based operation identity and 96-byte authorization now define the integration boundary. The supported narrower contract scope is explicit in `TREASURY_INTERFACE.md`; the existing deployed contract was not modified or redeployed. The independent accounting model derives balances from accepted operation histories. `RECOVERY.md` documents direct owner recovery through contracts/shared only, including pending expiry, reserve-wide withdrawal and restart semantics. New evidence is local; the committed testnet manifest remains historical. Wallet-stack advisory migration stays a production follow-up.

Readiness verification on 6 November 2026, Node.js 22.23.4: repository/ABI drift checks, lint, types and compilation passed; 21 contract scenarios, 13 backend checks, 5 protocol/model checks (including 100 fixed-seed histories) and 5 authentication checks passed. Contract/model differential traces used seeds 7, 19 and 41. The production build and HTTP smoke checks passed after disabling Turbopack disk persistence for this external volume's cache reload failure. New direct recovery proof is local, with no application services or live transactions.

## Independent browser recovery implementation

A standalone static recovery page now shares the CLI recovery core and builds through `npm run recovery:build --prefix contracts`. It requires owner-wallet approval, validates deployment identity, displays the reserve-wide withdrawal effect and waits for receipts. See [RECOVERY.md](RECOVERY.md). Chromium browser-wallet acceptance now passes against a real local EVM with an injected EIP-1193 fixture: owner/network checks, rejected approvals, consent and plan invalidation, pending expiry, exact withdrawal and idempotent repeat. The static build and CI browser test are verified. Manual extension-wallet/live recovery remains untested; no live funds moved in this verification.

## Checkpointed handoff reference implemented locally

The merchant phase is published at `2416da9`. The next-phase core adds durable per-task checkpoints, validated graph/artifact identity, deterministic eligibility and an assignment outbox. The SDK independently verifies contract state and the receipt's Paid event; the merchant serializes same-account submissions across concurrent tasks. A real local-EVM/HTTP four-task regression and `npm run demo:handoff` verify post-payment interruption, continued B/C/D progress, acknowledgement-loss reconciliation, old-worker rejection and original-result reuse before the remaining step. Exactly five unique purchases spend/credit 100 local base units. No live funds or model calls are involved. See `RUNNER.md`; four OS processes, task API/Postgres orchestration, encrypted checkpoints and a genuine model execution remain unfinished.

## Environment integration and live merchant hardening

The restored backend environment passes read-only preflight: owner matches the pinned treasury and all three dedicated accounts have nonzero test HBAR. The supplied frontend verification-key value was invalid; the app public ES256 key was retrieved from Privy's public JWKS endpoint and installed only in ignored `.env.local`. Authentication regressions and the production build pass; invalid tokens return 401 with the real environment and the app secret is absent from browser JavaScript. Environment files remain ignored with mode 0600.

Merchant safeguards now cover confirmation depth, cached receipt reconciliation, bounded log scans, testnet transaction fee ceilings, HTTPS outside loopback and signer-process exclusion. Nineteen backend tests pass. The authorized live check now passes: exactly 20,000 test-USDC base units were debited from the treasury and credited to the merchant; replay reused the same payment transaction and result hash. Allocation reconciliation now pins latest/pending nonce and persists signed bytes/hash before broadcast. The completed-run guard was rerun successfully without new transactions. Public evidence is in `backend/hedera/evidence/task-aware-live-proof.json`. Native consensus child-record verification and production qualification remain separate. See `MERCHANT_LIVE_SETUP.md`. Browser recovery now passes local Chromium wallet acceptance.

## Phase 5 paid research acceptance

Completed the bounded CLI research-to-paid-tool-to-replacement gate: separate worker processes, three paid task sources, confirmed onchain replacement, old-worker refusal and original transaction/artifact reuse. Five real Groq calls produced a final report; treasury transactions were local EVM fixtures. Evidence: [phase5-paid-research.json](evidence/phase5-paid-research.json). Reproduction and limitations: [PHASE5.md](PHASE5.md). Trusted supervisor bindings are implemented; connected dashboard financial controls, encrypted checkpoints and production scheduling remain separate gates. No new sponsor qualification is claimed.

## Phase 6 authoritative treasury dashboard

Overview/Tasks now default to validated chain reads, block-pinned balances, bounded event discovery and receipt-confirmed owner/scheduler actions. A separately downloadable static recovery copy is generated before frontend dev/build, with configurable RPC and no application dependency. Local Chromium acceptance covers actual dashboard actions and independent recovery with the dashboard server stopped; static wallet recovery has its own acceptance test. See [PHASE6.md](PHASE6.md). No manual live recovery, production readiness or new sponsor acceptance is claimed.

## Funded Arkiv discovery verified

On 7 November 2026 the dedicated Rabdi writer published two expiring profiles. Independent CLI and actual React/SDK reads found the Hedera-compatible record; the live-discovery/local-finance handoff selected the other profile, confirmed epoch 2, preserved unrelated tasks and reused the original paid result. [Publication, query, receipt and browser evidence](../backend/arkiv/evidence/2026-11-07/README.md) labels the boundaries. This clears the former empty-writer/funded-publication blocker. Entities expire after one hour; there is one writer, no external adoption measurement, no new live Hedera payment and no claim that browser research-run reassignment or all sponsor requirements are complete.
